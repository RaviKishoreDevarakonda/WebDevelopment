/* JS has some defined Keywords,
const cannot be changed 

let can be changed
var can be changed
for city nothing is declared


When we declare a variable a certain amount of memory is reserved and the name
 is given as the variable name for that memory location
Variables can be declared using 2 ways
var and let

We have something called as scope.
so we use only let to avoid the issues with scope,
beacause of block scope and functional scope


We don't use var
We can also declare without datatype, but this is not recommended
But with this method also the memory is reserved.

If it is declared and not defined it is given as undefined
